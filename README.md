Bitbucket Pull request validator

A small .net core app to validate production code meets validation standards.
Coded as simple as possible.

Build it -> Run it providing a date in YYYY-MM-dd format (or nothing then previous day will be taken) -> results will save in a txt file in the working directory.

Dockerfile available.
